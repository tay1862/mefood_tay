## MeFood Enhanced Project: Next Steps

This document outlines the current status of the `mefood-enhanced` project and the proposed next steps for further development and testing.

### Current Status:

The following major features have been implemented and integrated into the project:

1.  **Staff Management and Role-based Access Control:**
    *   Ability to manage staff with 6 predefined roles (Admin, Waiter, Kitchen, Cafe, Water Station, Cashier).
    *   Role-based access control is in place.
    *   Admin panel UI for staff management.

2.  **Department Management:**
    *   Ability to manage departments (e.g., Kitchen, Cafe, Water Station).
    *   Menu item assignment to specific departments for order routing.
    *   Admin panel UI for department management.

3.  **QR Code System for Customers:**
    *   Generation of unique QR codes for each table.
    *   Customers can scan QR codes to start a session, view menus, and place orders.
    *   Features for customers to call staff (with various request types) and request music.
    *   Real-time QR session management in the admin panel.

4.  **Lao Language and Kip Currency Support:**
    *   Full localization support for Thai, English, and Lao languages.
    *   Currency formatting for Thai Baht, US Dollar, and Lao Kip.

5.  **Advanced Table Management:**
    *   **Move Table:** Functionality to transfer customers and their orders from one table to another.
    *   **Merge Tables:** Functionality to combine orders from multiple tables into a single bill.
    *   Admin panel UI for these operations.

### Remaining Development (Phase 2 - Advanced Order Management & Bill Splitting):

Based on our previous discussions, the following features are planned for further development:

1.  **Bill Splitting (แยกบิล):**
    *   Develop a system to allow customers or cashiers to split bills (e.g., by item, by guest, or equal split).
    *   This will involve database schema updates and new API endpoints.

2.  **Advanced Order Management:**
    *   **Order Cancellation:** Implement functionality to cancel orders with reasons.
    *   **Order Modification:** Allow modification of existing orders (e.g., changing quantity, adding/removing toppings).
    *   **Real-time Order Dashboard:** Create a dashboard for kitchen and other departments to track order status in real-time.
    *   **Order Confirmation:** Implement a system for kitchen/department staff to confirm receipt and completion of orders.

### Next Steps for You:

1.  **Push the Code to GitHub:**
    You need to manually push the code to your new GitHub repository (`https://github.com/tay1862/mefood_tay.git`). Follow these steps to authenticate and push the `main` branch:
    ```bash
    cd /home/ubuntu/mefood-enhanced
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/tay1862/mefood_tay.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    You will be prompted for your GitHub username and password.

2.  **Review the Code and Features:**
    Familiarize yourself with the new features and code structure. The `system_overview.md` and `design_document.md` files provide a good starting point.

3.  **Set up Your Local Environment:**
    Ensure your local development environment is correctly set up as per `installation_guide.md` and `user_manual.md`.

4.  **Test the Implemented Features:**
    Thoroughly test all the features that have been implemented so far. Pay close attention to the advanced table management (move/merge) and the QR code system.

5.  **Provide Feedback:**
    Once you have reviewed and tested, please provide feedback on the implemented features and any further requirements or modifications you might have.

I am ready to continue with the remaining development tasks once you confirm the code has been pushed and you are ready to proceed. Please let me know when you are ready for me to continue with the **Bill Splitting** and **Advanced Order Management** features.
